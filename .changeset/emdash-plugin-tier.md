'@getvitops/utils': minor
'@getvitops/astro': patch
---

Extract schema.org JSON-LD graph builders (articleGraph/organizationGraph/breadcrumbGraph/faqGraph) into @getvitops/utils so platform hooks (e.g. the new @getvitops/emdash plugin's future page:metadata contributions) can share them; the corresponding schemas/\*.astro become thin wrappers. Also removes Layout.astro's import of the deleted Polyfills.astro.
