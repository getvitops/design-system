This repo is responsible for generating design systems for use in websites (primarily Astro and WordPress with Bricks Builder).

It is composed of:

- TS-based utilities
- Variable-based lightweight CSS Framework for high level design patterns and common utilities (e.g. track-based centering of content, vertical rhythm, UI patterns)
- Lit-based Web Components for patterns that benefit from progressive enhancement (they are styled via the CSS Framework, and are fully operable, although degraded, in non-JS environments)

Prefer using modern CSS/HTML features (e.g. CSS Anchor Positioning API, Dialog, Invoker Commands API, Scroll Timelines, etc.) over JavaScript.

## Development

The build system uses `vite-plus` (`vp`), which is a wrapper for common tools for SDLC tasks:

- `vite-task` (`npx vp run ...`) - task orchestration with caching, even across monorepo packages
- `oxfmt` (`npx vp fmt`) - formatting md/css/js/ts/html
- `oxlint` (`npx vp lint`) - linting js/ts
- `vitest` (`npx vp test`) - unit/integration testing
- `vite` (`npx vp build`) - libraries/application build meta-tool for web runtimes
- `tsdown` (`npx vp pack`) - libraries/applications build meta-tool for server runtimes

It also supports:

- running pre-commit hooks on staged files using the `staged` key in `vite.config.ts`

They are all configured with their respective keys in `vite.config.ts`

Other tools used:

- `gale` - css linting
- `lightningcss` - css minification/bundling
- `playwright` - e2e testing

### Task Notes

- do not run format or lint as verifications, these are done automatically on save and PostToolUse hooks.
- `index.html` is the evergreen docsite, make sure it's kept up to date

## Output

- Bricks Builder supports some design system features out of the box (e.g. Font, Spacing, Typography, and Color Managers), so when targeting it some parts that would be in the CSS output are instead output as JSON so they can be imported into Bricks for use in the UI and which outputs the CSS itself.

## Design Guidelines

- Set of CSS properties for colors, spacing, typography (fonts, scale, roles: display|title|heading|body|quote|caption|eyebrow|code|lead|footnote|tag (each with font, size, decoration, transform, tracking, etc.)), animations (kinds, curves, durations), pattern primitives (border, drop-shadow, padding)
- General layout utilities (.centered, .flex*, .split*, .rhythm)
- Color utilities (.bg*, .text*)
- Spacing utilties (.space\*)
- Typographic utilities (.font-display, .font-title, ...)
- Animation utilities (see @src/css/animations.css)
- Patterns (link, button, card, badge, etc.)
