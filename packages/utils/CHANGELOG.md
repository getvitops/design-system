### Major Changes

- 6e68ace: **Breaking:** the site config is now a three-section `Config` — `designSystem`,
  `organization`, `site`.

  The flat `SiteConfig` held the company (`organization`, `contact`, `locations`) and the
  deployment (`analytics`, `environments`, `seo`, `legal`) as peers, so no single noun
  described it, and a second site sharing the same company had no way to say so. The three
  sections split those apart: several sites can now carry one `organization` and differ only
  in `site`.

  **Migrating.** `designSystem` stays at the root, and the fields already under
  `organization` stay where they are. Everything else moves into one of two sections:
  - → `site`: `defaultLocale`, `locales`, `domains`, `dns`, `cloudflare`, `environments`,
    `abTesting`, `fonts`, `tags`, `postTypes`, `galleries`, `testimonials`, `templates`,
    `navigation`, `seo`, `analytics`, `notifications`, `tracking`, `security`, `legal`,
    `icons`, `favicon`, `deployment`
  - → `organization`: `contact`, `primaryLocation`, `locations`, `services`, `links`

  You do not have to work this out from the list: `vitops validate` detects a pre-3.0 flat
  config and prints every move by name, rather than reporting a dozen unknown keys.

  ```jsonc
  {
    "designSystem": {
      "themes": {
        "default": {
          /* … */
        },
      },
    },
    "organization": {
      "name": "Acme",
      "contact": "hq",
      "locations": {
        "hq": {
          /* … */
        },
      },
    },
    "site": {
      "defaultLocale": "en",
      "domains": {
        /* … */
      },
      "analytics": {
        /* … */
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  **Renamed exports** (`@getvitops/generator`): `SiteConfigSchema` → `ConfigSchema`,
  `SiteConfig` → `Config`, `validateSite` → `validateConfig`, `resolveSiteConfig` →
  `resolveConfig`, `isSiteConfig` → `isConfig`, `siteJsonSchema` → `configJsonSchema`,
  `SITE_SCHEMA_URL` → `CONFIG_SCHEMA_URL`, `SiteValidationResult` →
  `ConfigValidationResult`. `ResolvedInput.site` is now `ResolvedInput.config`. New:
  `OrganizationConfig` and `SiteSection` for the two sections.

  **Renamed schema file:** `@getvitops/generator/site.schema.json` →
  `@getvitops/generator/config.schema.json`. Update the `$schema` key in your config.

  Option names are unchanged — `vitops({ site: { input } })`, the Vite plugin's `site`,
  and `generate({ site })` still point at the config file.

  **The Astro integration is now `vitops()`, not `getvitops()`.** It is a default export,
  so the name is yours and nothing breaks on upgrade, but every example now reads
  `import vitops from '@getvitops/astro'` — matching the Vite plugin, which has always been
  `vitops`. The `@getvitops/*` package scope and the internal `virtual:getvitops/*` module
  ids are unchanged; neither is an import name.

  **Added:** a generated config authoring reference — `vitops docs config`, `docs/config.md`
  in the OKF bundle, and _Config reference_ on the docs site. It is walked from the published
  JSON Schema by the same helper that renders the `design-system.json` reference, so it
  cannot describe a field validation does not accept.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 20e518e: Add `vitops indexing` — tell search engines about a deploy, instead of opening Search Console by hand.

  Configure it in your site config under `seo.indexing`, then run it after deploying:

  ```jsonc
  "seo": {
    "indexing": {
      "indexNow": { "key": "…" },
      "searchConsole": { "siteUrl": "sc-domain:acme.ca" },
      "priorityUrls": ["https://acme.ca/", "https://acme.ca/services"]
    }
  }
  ```

  ```
  vitops indexing --dry     # print the plan, make no requests
  vitops indexing           # submit
  vitops indexing --check   # a day or two later: did Google actually index them?
  ```

  It reads your sitemap, diffs it against the previous run, and submits only what changed —
  pinging **IndexNow** and re-submitting your sitemap through the **Search Console API**.
  `--check` inspects `priorityUrls` and exits non-zero on a page Google hasn't indexed, so a
  scheduled CI job can catch a page that quietly fell out of the index.

  **Be clear-eyed about what this can do.** Google exposes no API that requests indexing — the
  button in Search Console isn't available anywhere, URL Inspection is read-only, and the sitemap
  ping endpoint was removed in 2023. IndexNow reaches Bing, Yandex, Naver, Seznam and Yep; Google
  doesn't participate. So this automates every sanctioned step and then verifies the outcome; it
  does not make Google re-index on demand, and nothing can. Google's Indexing API is deliberately
  not wired: it's scoped to job postings and livestreams, and using it for ordinary pages violates
  its terms.

  Also new, and worth wiring at the same time — **`gitLastmod()` for real sitemap dates**:

  ```js
  import vitops, { gitLastmod } from '@getvitops/astro';
  vitops({ sitemap: { serialize: await gitLastmod() } });
  ```

  `@astrojs/sitemap` emits no `<lastmod>` by default, which means a crawler is told your pages
  exist but never that one changed — and it's what lets `vitops indexing` submit a handful of URLs instead
  of all of them. `gitLastmod()` derives each date from the source file's last commit, and leaves a
  page alone rather than guessing (dynamic routes, ambiguous slugs, shallow clones): an inaccurate
  `lastmod` is worse than none, because Google stops trusting the field site-wide.

  Requires `fetch-depth: 0` in CI — the default shallow clone has no history to read, and it warns
  when that's the case.

  **Credentials.** IndexNow's key is public by design (it's served at `/<key>.txt` as the ownership
  proof), so it lives in your config, and the Astro integration writes the file into `public/` for
  you — `vitops indexing --new-key` generates one, `--write-key <dir>` writes it for non-Astro stacks.
  Search Console needs a service account in `VITOPS_GSC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` or
  `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, added as an owner of the property; it's never read from the
  config file.

  Persist `.vitops/` between runs (a CI cache) — that's the changed-URL state, and without it every
  run submits everything.

  An environment whose `robots` policy says `noindex` is refused outright, so pointing this at
  staging can't publish it to a search engine.

- 9bf975a: Add `vitops media` — encode raw video into web-ready outputs, instead of hand-rolling an ffmpeg
  script per project.

  Keep unprocessed video in a `raw/` directory and run:

  ```
  vitops media --raw raw --out src/assets/processed
  ```

  Each source becomes three files: **VP9/WebM**, an **H.264/MP4** fallback, and a **JPG poster**.
  Import them like any other asset, so your bundler content-hashes them:

  ```astro
  ---
  import hero from '../assets/processed/hero.webm';
  import poster from '../assets/processed/hero.jpg';
  ---
  <video poster={poster.src} autoplay muted loop playsinline>
    <source src={hero} type="video/webm" />
  </video>
  ```

  In Astro it's an integration option — `vitops({ css, media: { raw: 'raw', out: 'src/assets/processed' } })`
  — and it runs in the same pass that generates your CSS. `@getvitops/vite` gains a matching `media`
  option, and `@getvitops/utils/media` exports `processMedia()` for anything else.

  Defaults: capped at 1920px wide, CRF 32, audio dropped (the common case is a muted autoplay loop),
  poster from frame 0. All of them are flags. `--dry` prints exactly what a run would do.

  **Runs are cached**, on source content plus encode settings, in `.vitops/media-manifest.json` — a
  24 MB clip that took 88 seconds the first time takes 0.14 seconds the second. A missing output
  re-encodes; a corrupt manifest re-encodes everything. Neither ever reads as "already done", because
  that failure is silent and no rebuild would fix it.

  **Commit the outputs and the manifest.** A fresh CI clone has neither and would re-encode from
  scratch; committing both means CI never needs ffmpeg. It also keeps your history clean — ffmpeg
  output isn't byte-reproducible across versions, so a CI re-encode would rewrite every video on any
  toolchain bump. Use `--force` when you mean to re-encode.

  **`ffmpeg` is an external tool, not an npm dependency** — install it yourself (`brew install
ffmpeg`, `apt install ffmpeg`, `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`). The command fails without it rather
  than skipping: a page referencing a video that was never encoded is broken, not degraded.

  Two defaults worth knowing about. The MP4 exists because older iOS and the in-app webviews inside
  social apps still don't decode VP9, and it's written with `+faststart` — without which a browser
  downloads the whole file before showing frame one. And a poster taken from frame 0 is often black
  on a clip that fades in; that's `--poster-time`, not a bug.

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 04a51d8: Icons: one semantic vocabulary across icon sets, with the bundle derived from your source.

  Name icons by meaning — `<Icon name="menu" />` resolves to `fa7-solid:bars`, `ph:list` or
  `lucide:menu` depending on the set you configure, so swapping sets is a config edit rather than a
  find-and-replace. A name containing `:` still passes through untouched, which is the escape hatch
  for a set-specific glyph.

  **New `icons` option on `getvitops()`.** Configures the sets once per site and, under
  `output: 'server'`, derives astro-icon's `include` map by scanning your source — the list most
  projects end up maintaining by hand. On a static build no `include` is passed at all, because
  astro-icon is already zero-config there and a list could only drop a glyph the scan couldn't see.
  Names you declare that don't resolve fail the build; names only the scan found just warn; names
  computed at runtime are reported with file and line so you can declare them.

  **New `<Icon />` component**, and a real fix with it: `Popover`, `Details` and `Drawer` imported
  `astro-icon/components` at module scope, so the _optional_ peer was resolved whether or not an icon
  ever rendered — hard-failing anyone who hadn't installed it. Engines now load dynamically. The
  per-component `iconResolver` prop still works but is deprecated in favour of the integration option.

  **New SVG sprite** (`icons.sprite: true` in your site config) for consumers that can't run an icon
  integration — Bricks/WordPress, EmDash renderers, plain HTML. `<use href="…/icons.svg#ph--list">`,
  no JavaScript and no icon-API request. Every semantic name also gets a set-independent `icon-<name>`
  alias, so sprite markup survives an icon-set change. WordPress gets `vitops_icon()`, a
  `[vitops_icon]` shortcode and a **Vitops → Icon** Bricks element.

  **New `vitops icons`** command: reports which icons your source uses, which names couldn't be
  resolved, and which are computed at runtime; `--sprite` builds the sprite, `--json` for CI.

  **Renamed, and completed to all four directions.** Chevrons and arrows are the
  one family whose _meaning is_ its direction, and that direction is physical, not
  logical — a chevron in a details marker points down in every writing mode. So they
  are named for where they point: `expand-more`/`expand-less` →
  `chevron-down`/`chevron-up`, and `arrow-forward`/`arrow-back` →
  `arrow-right`/`arrow-left`. `chevron-left`/`chevron-right` keep their names.
  `arrow-up`/`arrow-down` are new, so both families now cover all four directions.
  `lightning` is new.

  If you passed any of the old names to `<Icon />`, `resolveIcon` or an `icons`
  config, update them. They fail loudly rather than silently: an unresolvable
  declared name throws, and `vitops icons` reports scanned ones.

  **Fixed three Font Awesome mappings that named no real glyph** and so rendered an
  empty box: `login`/`logout` were mapped to `login`/`logout` (Font Awesome calls
  them `right-to-bracket`/`right-from-bracket`) and `backup` to `backup`
  (`cloud-arrow-up`). Every value in all four UI sets is now checked against the
  installed collection.

  **Phosphor (`ph`) joins the semantic map**, with all 83 names verified against the real icon set.
  Phosphor keeps every weight in one collection and varies the name (`list`, `list-bold`), unlike Font
  Awesome's per-weight collections, so `resolveIcon` and `generateIconInclude` gained a `weight`
  option for sets shaped that way.

  Fixes: `site.icons` was a closed object, so any icon collection not in its hand-written key list was
  silently dropped during validation — your config passed and the icons never bundled. It accepts any
  collection name now.

- bf453b0: Maskable favicons are now opaque, so they stop rendering as a logo in a black box.

  `icon-mask.png` is declared `purpose: "maskable"` and `apple-touch-icon.png` is linked on every
  page. Both sit a deliberately-inset logo on a larger canvas — that inset **is** the maskable safe
  zone and was always correct — but the canvas was filled with `alpha: 0`. From any transparent
  source that left 36% of `icon-mask.png` and 40% of `apple-touch-icon.png` transparent, on two files
  whose entire contract is full bleed: the OS crops them to its own shape and composites the rest onto
  whatever it likes, usually black. iOS discards alpha on the apple-touch-icon outright.

  `backgroundColor` was already the obvious input for this and already plumbed — as far as the web
  manifest, and no further. So the raster and the manifest disagreed about the very colour meant to
  sit behind the icon.

  Now:
  - those two outputs are composited onto `backgroundColor`, defaulting to `#ffffff` — the same
    default the manifest's `background_color` already used;
  - `favicon.svg`, `icon-{16,32,192,512}.png` and `favicon.ico` keep the source's transparency, since
    none of them is maskable;
  - a transparent source with no `backgroundColor` set now warns, rather than silently inheriting
    white — a dark logo would lose against it;
  - `icon-192`/`icon-512` declare `purpose: "any"` explicitly. Omitting it was legal (unset means
    "any"), but with a maskable present and nothing claiming "any", some launchers picked the maskable
    — the one with the safe-zone inset — for slots that wanted a plain icon.

  `vitops favicon` gained `--background <hex>`; it previously had no way to set this at all.
  `getvitops({ favicon })` and the Vite plugin now forward the option they were already accepting.

- bf453b0: A chroma-0 seed now produces an actual neutral instead of a pink one.

  Beyond a ramp's outermost authored colour, chroma decays towards a small endpoint value (0.008
  light / 0.015 dark) so the near-white and near-black ends keep a whisper of the hue. That was
  written as a lerp _target_, and the interpolation factor reaches exactly 1 at steps 50 and 950 for
  every anchor position — so the endpoints were those constants **unconditionally**. Seeds at chroma
  0.001, 0.002, 0.05 and 0.2 all produced a byte-identical `#f5f9fe` at step 50.

  There was therefore no seed that yielded a plain neutral, and chroma 0 was the worst case: a true
  achromatic colour has no hue (colorjs returns NaN), which collapses to 0 — red — so asking for grey
  gave you `#fdf6f8`, a pink. A brand wanting plain white with grey panels had to discover `anchors`
  to get there.

  The endpoint is now a **ceiling** rather than a target, so a seed below it keeps its own chroma:

  | seed chroma | step 50 before | step 50 after |
  | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
  | 0           | `#fdf6f8` 🩷   | `#f8f8f8`     |
  | 0.001       | `#f5f9fe`      | `#f8f8f9`     |
  | 0.003       | `#f5f9fe`      | `#f7f8fa`     |
  | 0.05        | `#f5f9fe`      | `#f5f9fe`     |

  `seed: "#808080"` now gives a real grey ramp — `#f8f8f8` / `#eee` / `#808080` / `#2b2b2b` / `#181818`.

  **No existing palette moves.** The ceiling only binds below itself, and every ordinary brand hue
  sits above it; the repo's own `tokens.json` is byte-identical across this change.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- bb92a14: **The colour system is rebuilt on a target-prefixed grammar and a shared lightness ladder.**
  This is a breaking change to every colour token and utility class.

  ## Why

  Two axes shared one class namespace — functional _planes_ (`--<role>-bg-muted`) and
  appearance-relative _stops_ (`--color-<role>-muted`) — arbitrated by a "plane wins" rule. The
  result was not a scale. On the shipped palette, light mode:

  | class                              | resolved to  | step                                          |
  | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
  | `bg-ui-accent-x-muted`             | stop         | 100                                           |
  | `bg-ui-accent-muted`               | plane        | 100 — identical, so `x-muted` was a dead rung |
  | `bg-ui-accent`                     | plane        | 50 — _lighter_ than both its "muted" rungs    |
  | `border-ui-accent-muted` / `-bold` | stop / plane | 300 / 300 — identical                         |
  | `text-ui-accent-bold`              | stop         | 700 — _lighter_ than `text-…-muted` (800)     |

  Every family was non-monotonic, two had duplicate rungs, and `--color-<role>-muted` was
  unreachable through any `bg-` class.

  ## The new grammar

  ```
  --color-<target>-<role>[-<variant>]        target ∈ bg | text | icon | border
  ```

  The target is **inside** the name, so `bg-danger-muted` and `text-danger-muted` are different
  tokens and there is nothing left to arbitrate. **The class name is the token name minus
  `--color-`** — one vocabulary instead of two.

  Variants are ordinal (`xx-muted` < `x-muted` < `muted` < bare < `bold` < `x-bold`) and the
  tables are sparse: only cells that hold their contrast target exist.

  ## Role kinds

  `colors.roles` values may now be `{ hue, kind }` as well as a bare hue string:

  ```jsonc
  "roles": {
    "danger":  "rust",                             // shorthand => chromatic
    "surface": { "hue": "navy", "kind": "surface" }
  }
  ```

  - **`surface`** — a page/panel colour: `bg-<role>` is the card, `bg-<role>-muted` the page
    behind it, `bg-<role>-x-muted` a well, `bg-<role>-bold` the inverse surface. Full text scale.
  - **`chromatic`** (default) — a signal colour: tints (`bg-<role>-x-muted`/`-muted`) and solids
    (`bg-<role>-solid[-bold|-x-bold]`), with **no bare `bg-<role>`** — say how loud you mean.
    `text-on-<role>` is the guaranteed foreground for the solid family.

  ## Palette generation

  Every ramp now sits on one **fixed lightness ladder** (50 → L 0.98 … 950 → L 0.21); only chroma
  and hue vary. That is what makes a step mean the same lightness in every hue. Previously each
  seed transposed the curve, so relative luminance at step 300 ranged from 0.253 to 0.384 across
  the shipped palette — the same variant read differently depending on the role.

  Authored colours are still reproduced **exactly**. A `seed`, an `anchors` entry or a `tones`
  value is pinned verbatim at its nearest step; every other step takes the ladder. Snapping brand
  colours to the ladder was measured and rejected: 11 of 18 real brand hexes moved beyond a
  just-noticeable difference (worst ΔE-OK 0.050 — Facebook's `#1877F2` → `#0067e1`) and six left
  sRGB gamut. Deviation is now bounded and local to pinned steps, and warns past ~0.03 L.

  Two tones that claim the same step now **error** instead of one silently overwriting the other;
  the record form (`tones: { "600": "…", "700": "…" }`) is how you resolve it.

  ## New
  - **`icon-<role>`** — a non-text tier, so a glyph may run more vivid than text. `icon` is now a
    default utility family alongside `bg`/`text`/`border`.
  - **`--color-border-focus`** — the focus-ring tone, taken from `ui-primary`'s solid.
  - **Contrast is enforced at build time**, not only in tests: text ≥ APCA Lc 75 on its primary
    background, ≥ 60 on secondary planes, icons and surface boundaries ≥ 45, both appearances.
    A violation now fails `generate`. Chromatic text is checked against the _surface_ planes it
    actually sits on, not only its own tints. `text-<role>-x-muted` (placeholder) and `-xx-muted`
    (disabled) are explicitly exempt; nothing else is.

  ## Migrating

  Rename `--<role>-<suffix>` → `--color-<target>-<role>[-<variant>]`, and the same for classes:

  | before                                  | after                                                            |
  | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `--<role>-bg` / `bg-<role>` (chromatic) | `--color-bg-<role>-x-muted` / `bg-<role>-x-muted`                |
  | `--<role>-bg-muted`                     | `--color-bg-<role>-muted`                                        |
  | `--<role>-solid` / `-solid-bold`        | `--color-bg-<role>-solid` / `-solid-bold`                        |
  | `--<role>-on-solid` / `text-on-<role>`  | `--color-text-on-<role>` (class unchanged)                       |
  | `--<role>-text` / `-text-muted`         | `--color-text-<role>` / `-muted`                                 |
  | `--<role>-border` / `-border-bold`      | `--color-border-<role>` / `-bold`                                |
  | `--color-<role>-muted` (stop)           | judge by use: `--color-bg-<role>-muted` or `--color-text-<role>` |

  **`surface` background names rotate**, value-preserving: what was `--surface-bg` (the page) is
  now `--color-bg-surface-muted`; what was `--surface-bg-bold` (raised) is now
  `--color-bg-surface`. Elevation is expressed by which token you reach for — page `bg-muted`,
  card `bg` — rather than a raised/sunken pair, which is what lets a future surfaces axis flatten
  it without touching markup.

  `vitops lint` reports role classes that no longer resolve, and now derives its suggestions from
  what the generator actually emits rather than a hand-maintained list.
