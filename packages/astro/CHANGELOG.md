## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- fd1a35b: Add `<Seo />` — page metadata for non-EmDash sites: `<title>`, description, canonical, Open Graph,
  Twitter cards, robots, `article:*`, `hreflang` and verification tokens.

  Site-level defaults go in the integration; pages pass only what differs.

  ```js
  // astro.config.mjs
  vitops({
    seo: {
      siteName: 'Acme',
      titleTemplate: '%s · Acme',
      defaultDescription: 'We make the thing.',
      openGraph: {
        locale: 'en_CA',
        image: { url: '/og.png', alt: 'Acme', width: 1200, height: 630 },
      },
      twitter: { site: '@acme' },
    },
  });
  ```

  ```astro
  ---
  import Seo from '@getvitops/astro/Seo.astro';
  ---
  <Seo title={title} description={description} image={cover} />
  ```

  **`<Seo />` owns `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` — remove them from your layout when you
  adopt it.** It already computes the resolved title for `og:title`/`twitter:title`, and emitting those
  in one place while the layout emits `<title>` in another is how the two drift apart. `<Head />` is
  unaffected and still handles favicons, theme-color and the web-component runtime; use both.

  Notable behaviour:
  - `titleTemplate` is skipped when a page's title already equals `siteName`, so a homepage titled
    "Acme" emits `Acme` rather than `Acme · Acme`. It never applies to `defaultTitle`.
  - Canonical, `og:url` and relative `og:image` values need the `site` astro.config option. Without it
    they're omitted rather than derived from the request URL — a canonical built from a dev or preview
    origin can de-index you — and the integration warns at build time. Absolute image URLs still work.
  - `robots` is omitted unless it says something; `index, follow` is what crawlers already assume. Use
    `noindex`/`nofollow`/`noarchive`/`nocache`/`robotsExtras` per page, `robots` for a full override, or
    `seo.robots` site-wide.
  - `twitter:card` upgrades to `summary_large_image` whenever an image resolves.
  - `hreflang` alternates are explicit only — pass `alternates`, including the current page. Nothing is
    inferred from a locale list.
  - No JSON-LD. The `./schemas/*` components take entity data and compose alongside it.

  **On an EmDash site use `<EmDashHead>` instead** — it emits the same tags from the CMS, and rendering
  both duplicates every one of them. The integration warns if `seo` is configured alongside `emdash()`.

  The merge logic ships as the pure `resolveSeo(defaults, props, ctx)` if you need to drive it yourself.

- 20252c2: Add an opt-in `sitemap` option to `getvitops()`, and link the result from `<Head />`.

  `sitemap: true` registers the official `@astrojs/sitemap` for you; pass an object to configure it
  (`filter`, `customPages`, `changefreq`, `priority`, `i18n`, `entryLimit`, `filenameBase`,
  `serialize`, …). `<Head />` gains a matching `<link rel="sitemap">`.

  ```js
  getvitops({ sitemap: true });
  getvitops({ sitemap: { filter: (page) => !page.includes('/draft/') } });
  ```

  `@astrojs/sitemap` is an **optional peer** — install it yourself (`pnpm add -D @astrojs/sitemap`) and
  the build fails with a message saying so if you don't, rather than silently emitting nothing. The
  option also needs the `site` astro.config option, since a sitemap lists absolute URLs; without it the
  option warns and skips. Note `@astrojs/sitemap` enumerates **prerendered** routes only, so on an
  `output: 'server'` site you'll want `export const prerender = true` on the pages you want indexed, or
  `sitemap.customPages`.

  **On an EmDash site, leave it off** — EmDash serves its own database-driven `/sitemap.xml`, which also
  covers on-demand pages a static sitemap can't. The option detects `emdash()` and skips with a warning.
  If you want both, add `sitemap()` to your own `integrations` array; getvitops detects that too and
  leaves yours in charge, which is also how you reach the few `@astrojs/sitemap` options this
  integration doesn't mirror.

  Also fixes the `virtual:getvitops/head` type declaration, which was missing the `editor` field that
  `<Head />` already reads — a type error in consumer projects that don't set `skipLibCheck`.

- bb92a14: Add a fourth output format, `design`, that emits `DESIGN.md` — the agent-facing brief in
  [google-labs-code/design.md](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) format.

  ```sh
  vitops generate --format design --out .     # DESIGN.md, and nothing else
  vitops generate --format css,design         # compose it with a stylesheet
  ```

  The file is YAML front matter carrying the tokens (`colors`, `typography`, `rounded`,
  `spacing`, `components`, cross-referenced with `{group.token}`) followed by a prose body
  carrying the rationale — colour model, fluid scales, layout vocabulary, elevation, shape
  cascade, component tiers, do's and don'ts. Every section is rendered from your config, so
  it cannot describe a system the other formats don't build. Point a coding agent, a Figma
  import, or a designer at this one file when they don't have the toolchain; `vitops docs`
  remains the richer reference for those who do.

  It is emitted with `--out .` in mind: DESIGN.md conventionally lives at a repo root beside
  `AGENTS.md`, not in a build directory.

  Three things the spec cannot express, handled the same way every time and explained in the
  emitted prose so the file is self-describing:
  - **Fluid `clamp()` sizes** → the maximum (desktop) value, since a spec `Dimension` is a
    bare number plus px/em/rem.
  - **Dark mode** → light values only, with the automatic functional flip explained. Role
    tokens are emitted as `{colors.<hue>-<step>}` references into the raw ramps rather than
    flattened hexes, so the role → ramp lineage survives the export — flattening them is
    exactly what breaks dark mode downstream.
  - **A `50%` radius** → dropped from `rounded` (it is not a `Dimension`) and named in the
    Shapes prose instead, so nothing is silently lost.

  **New:** an optional `meta` key in `design-system.json` (`{ name, description }`) supplies
  the brand name and the Overview paragraph. It affects no other format.

  **New:** `StylesheetFormat` (`Exclude<Format, 'design'>`), exported from
  `@getvitops/generator`. `@getvitops/astro`'s `css.format` now takes that narrower type —
  `design` produces no stylesheet to inject, so passing it there is a type error rather than
  a missing-file failure at build time. `vitops lint --format` is likewise restricted to the
  three CSS formats. No change for anyone already passing `tailwind`, `css` or `bricks`.

- bb92a14: Generate legal documents from your site config

  `vitops legal` renders a privacy policy, terms of service and cookie notice from a site
  config, in markdown, HTML or EmDash Portable Text:

  ```sh
  vitops legal --out ./content                 # every enabled document, as markdown
  vitops legal --doc privacy --format html     # one document, as an HTML fragment
  ```

  The documents are **derived from your config**, not filled into a form. The analytics
  provider they name is the one whose ID you set; the personal information they list is what
  your configured forms actually collect; the countries they name come from the providers you
  use. So a provider swap updates the policy on the next build, and the fix for a wrong policy
  is a corrected config — hand-editing the output is overwritten.

  Enable documents under `legal`, which gains the facts the prose asserts:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "legal": {
      "jurisdiction": "ca", // only 'ca' (PIPEDA) ships today
      "privacyPolicy": {
        "enabled": true,
        "lastUpdated": "2026-08-01",
        "retention": "24 months after our last contact with you",
        // Third parties the config cannot imply. Analytics, Turnstile and your
        // deploy platform are detected automatically — list only the rest.
        "processors": [
          {
            "name": "Stripe",
            "purpose": "payment processing",
            "country": "the United States",
          },
        ],
      },
      "termsOfService": { "enabled": true },
      "cookieConsent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "type": "opt-in",
        "categories": ["Essential", "Analytics"],
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  Delivery, by stack:
  - **Any stack** — `vitops legal`. No integration code; prints to stdout without `--out`.
  - **WordPress/Bricks** — `vitops generate --site <path>` also writes `dist/legal/*.html`, and
    the theme loader now registers `[vitops_legal doc="privacy"]` to render one in a page. The
    document updates on the next deploy with no action in WordPress.
  - **Astro** — `getvitops({ legal: { input: 'site.json', out: 'src/content/legal' } })` writes
    markdown into a content collection and re-renders when the site config changes. It needs a
    `css` config (that is what registers the Vite plugin); without one, use the CLI.
  - **EmDash** — `--format portable-text`, pasted into the admin.

  Also new on the public API: `generateLegal()`, `renderMarkdown()`, `renderNodes()`,
  `derivePolicyVars()`, `parseMarkdown()` / `toHtmlFragment()` / `toPortableText()`, and
  `resolvePrivacyContact()`.

  Two things to know before you publish anything this produces:
  - **It is not legal advice.** Every document opens with a review banner saying so. The
    bundled terms-of-service prose in particular is generic website boilerplate and
    deliberately does not cover sales, refunds, subscriptions, accounts or user-generated
    content — a site doing any of those needs clauses drafted for it.
  - **It is only as true as your config.** A policy asserting things your site does not do is
    worse than no policy. Check that the config describes reality before you ship the output.

  `validateSite` now rejects a config that enables a privacy policy without a contact for
  privacy requests or a `domains.canonical`, since both are interpolated into sentences that
  would otherwise render blank.

### Patch Changes

- bb92a14: Docs: import the Astro integration as `vitops`, and document the fourth output format.

  Every example now reads `import vitops from '@getvitops/astro'` and calls `vitops({ … })`,
  including the scaffolded `emdash` template. The default export is unchanged, so this is a
  naming convention in the docs rather than an API change — existing configs that bind it as
  `getvitops` keep working.

  The `@getvitops/generator` and `@getvitops/cli` docs also describe the `design` format, which
  was shipped without a mention in either package's output table: `--format design` writes a
  single `DESIGN.md` and no CSS, so a run that composes it with a stylesheet wants its own
  `--out` (the brief conventionally sits at a repo root, the stylesheet does not).

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- **Fixed: `Subgrid` and `Cards` rendered as unstyled lists, in every format.**

  `Subgrid.astro` drew its geometry with Tailwind utilities — `grid-rows-subgrid` and
  `row-span-(--row-span)`, the latter Tailwind v4's arbitrary-CSS-variable syntax. No framework CSS
  layer defines those, so under `css.format: 'css'` or `'bricks'` the component had no layout at all.

  It failed under `'tailwind'` too, which is the part worth internalising: **Tailwind v4 is JIT and
  does not scan `node_modules`**, so a class that only a shipped component references is never
  generated. A consumer had to add the package to Tailwind's `@source` by hand to get a subgrid;
  without that, cards silently laid out at `grid-row: auto` — visually plausible, quietly wrong. The
  same trap applied to `grid` in `Subgrid` and `sr-only` / `not-sr-only` in `Popover` / `Drawer`:
  those are in the generator's `TW_CLASH` list, so the framework strips its own rules for them from
  the tailwind bundle and defers to Tailwind — meaning they resolved only when the consumer's own
  templates happened to use the same class.

  The components now emit framework classes only, and the `subgrid` pattern owns the layout:
  - `Subgrid` renders `<ul class="subgrid"><li>…` and ships no `<style>` block of its own.
  - `Popover` / `Drawer` use a component-scoped `visually-hidden` instead of `sr-only`. The
    `not-sr-only` on their icons was a no-op and is gone.
  - The `subgrid` pattern absorbed the wrapped-row margin the component used to carry, so
    hand-written `.subgrid` markup gets it too, and resets list markers on `ul`/`ol`.

  **Also fixed: `Cards` discarded the `card` class and every class you put on a child.** It wrote
  `card` onto the slotted element and then serialised that element's _inner_ HTML, dropping the
  attribute it had just set. Child `class` and `style` now reach the rendered `<li>`.

  **Breaking — the subgrid custom properties are renamed.** One `--subgrid-*` vocabulary now covers
  both the pattern and the component; the old names are removed, not aliased:

  | removed                         | use                  |
  | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
  | `--items-per-row`, `--cols`     | `--subgrid-cols`     |
  | `--rows-per-item`, `--row-span` | `--subgrid-row-span` |
  | `--row-margin`                  | `--subgrid-row-gap`  |

  `--subgrid-gap` (the grid gap) is unchanged, as are the `.subgrid-cols-*` / `.subgrid-rows-*` /
  `.subgrid-responsive` modifiers. Anything still setting an old name falls back to the pattern
  defaults — 3 columns, span 2 — so grep for them when you upgrade.

- **`tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` are now optional peer dependencies, not dependencies.**

  Only `css.format: 'tailwind'` ever used them, but every consumer installed them — including
  `'css'` and `'bricks'` projects that never touch Tailwind. The integration now loads
  `@tailwindcss/vite` lazily inside that branch and throws a directive error if it is missing.

  **Migration:** if you use `css.format: 'tailwind'` (the default), add both to your
  `devDependencies` — `pnpm add -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite`. Most Tailwind projects already
  have them. Everyone else can drop them.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- a334049: Make the semantic icon mapping reachable, and fail the build on unresolvable names.

  `generateIconInclude()` — declare the semantic icon names a site needs plus which sets to draw
  them from, get back the `include` map that keeps the bundle to just those glyphs — already existed
  but was unreachable: it lived in `@getvitops/core/src/utils/`, which the package doesn't export.
  It has moved to `@getvitops/utils` (a build-time concern, in the build-time utilities package),
  which `@getvitops/astro` re-exports wholesale. So from `astro.config.mjs`:

  ```js
  import { generateIconInclude } from '@getvitops/astro';
  import icon from 'astro-icon';

  integrations: [
    icon({
      include: generateIconInclude({
        ui: 'fa7-solid',
        brand: 'simple-icons',
        semantic: ['menu', 'close', 'search', 'github'],
      }),
    }),
  ];
  // → { "fa7-solid": ["bars","xmark","magnifying-glass"], "simple-icons": ["github"] }
  ```

  Swapping `ui` to `'lucide'` yields `{ lucide: ["menu","x","search"] }` from the same declaration —
  which is the point: the semantic names are what your markup commits to, and the set is a config
  choice. The output shape is the `include` both `astro-icon` and `astro-iconset` accept, so the
  mapping doesn't tie you to either.

  **Unresolvable names are now a build error.** Previously they were skipped silently, so swapping
  sets appeared to succeed and the gaps surfaced as missing glyphs in production. The error names
  every offender; an unknown set name throws too, listing the known sets.

  Also fixes `@getvitops/create`'s emdash template, which pinned `@getvitops/astro: ^0.4.0` — a range
  that stopped resolving when astro joined the fixed group at 0.7.0, so scaffolded projects were
  stuck on the old line.

- **New: `<wc-theme-editor>`, a live theme editor you can ship with your site.**

  Tune the whole design system in the browser — palette, semantic roles, type roles, spacing, layout,
  pattern geometry, radii, shadows — with no rebuild. Edits are layered as `:root` custom-property
  overrides, persist to localStorage, and export as CSS or as a `design-system.json` patch. It follows
  your site's colour scheme and drives the same `data-theme` + storage key as `<color-scheme-toggle>`,
  so the two no longer fight.

  It ships as a **separate, opt-in bundle** (`@getvitops/core/editor`, ~13 kB, no Lit) and is never
  registered in `elements.js`: a page that doesn't ask for it pays nothing.

  ```js
  // astro.config.mjs
  getvitops({
    css: { input: 'design-system.json', format: 'css', out: 'src/styles' },
    editor: true,
  });
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- anywhere in your layout -->
  <wc-theme-editor></wc-theme-editor>
  ```

  `editor: true` copies `editor.js` into `public/vitops/`, loads it from `<Head />`, and mirrors
  `design-manifest.json` to `/vitops/design-manifest.json` (override with the `manifest` attribute).
  Outside Astro, load the bundle yourself and point `manifest` at the file.

  **Save straight back to your config, in dev.** `@getvitops/vite` now serves a dev-only
  `/__vitops/design-system` endpoint: the editor POSTs its patch, the plugin deep-merges it into your
  `design-system.json`, validates the _merged_ result, writes it back preserving the file's formatting,
  then regenerates and reloads. The endpoint exists only under `vite dev` — on a static deploy the
  editor detects its absence and hides the button, while everything else still works.

  **Added:** `colors.roleTokens` in `design-manifest.json` — the functional token set (bg / border /
  solid / on-solid / text / emphasis stops) precomputed per hue, in `default` and `surface` variants for
  both appearances. Re-pointing a role at another hue needs these: `solid` is chosen by scanning the hue
  and `on-solid` is a computed contrast value, so neither is derivable by a browser client.

  **Removed:** the dead `interaction` block from `design-manifest.json` — a hardcoded
  `{duration, easing}` literal with no schema key, no reverse-index entry, and no corresponding CSS
  variable. Nothing could have consumed it meaningfully. The real animation knobs are
  `--animation-duration-*` / `--custom-ease-*`.

  **Fixed:** a `[popover]` reset in `popover.css` was stripping the background, padding and border from
  any pattern used as a popover. It is imported after `drawer.css`, so at equal specificity it beat
  `.drawer` — and `dialog` (0-0-1) too — leaving a `.drawer[popover]` transparent and unpadded despite
  drawer.css documenting popover as supported. The reset now sits in `:where()` at zero specificity, so
  it still overrides the UA stylesheet but any pattern class takes its surface back. Open/closed
  behaviour is unchanged.

  **Added:** `input[type="range"]` and `input[type="color"]` now have baseline styling in `forms.css`
  (accent colour from `--ui-primary-solid`; the colour swatch picks up the control border and radius).

### Patch Changes

- aa2863d: Persist the colour scheme across navigations, and drop the UA body margin.

  **The colour scheme now sticks.** `<color-scheme-toggle>` records the explicit choice in
  `localStorage` (`vitops-color-scheme`) and restores it on load. Previously every navigation reset
  to System — the component defaulted to `system` on each page and its `disconnectedCallback` even
  deleted the attribute on unmount, so the scheme was per-page state rather than a user preference.
  Choosing System clears the key, so a visitor can go back to following their OS.

  `<Head />` from `@getvitops/astro` now also emits a tiny synchronous script that applies the stored
  value **before first paint**. Without it the persisted choice would still work, but every page
  would render light and flip once the deferred element bundle upgraded. A test asserts the storage
  key stays in step between the two (they can't share an import: core exports only prebuilt bundles,
  and the Head script must be a literal in the emitted HTML).

  **`body { margin: 0 }`** is now part of the framework. The UA's 8px margin offset every full-bleed
  surface — sticky headers and `bg-*` bands rendered inset with a sliver of canvas around them, since
  the framework owns page gutters through `.centered`'s `--gutter`. This is the only UA reset the
  framework makes; it deliberately still ships no general reset (no global `box-sizing` change),
  which would silently reflow existing layouts.

  **Migration:** if you were compensating for the body margin with a negative offset or your own
  `body { margin: 0 }`, you can drop it. Sites relying on the 8px inset will need to add their own
  padding.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 44de07f: Split the button pattern into two tiers named by intent: `.cta` (persuasion) and `.btn`
  (affordance).

  **Breaking: a bare `<button>` is no longer a filled brand-primary button.** It now renders as a
  quiet interactive control — geometry, cursor, subtle hover, focus ring — with no fill, no
  `font-weight: 600`, and no shadow.

  **Migration:** add `class="cta"` to any button that should stay prominent. Submit buttons, hero
  actions, and anything driving a conversion are the usual candidates; dialog closes, toolbar
  buttons, icon buttons and toggles should keep the new default. If you want the old behaviour
  globally, set `patterns.items.btn` in your `design-system.json` back to the previous filled base.

  New in this release:
  - **`.cta`** — filled, bolder, roomier, lifts on hover. It is a class, not an element rule, so it
    finally works on `<a>` — which is what a call to action usually is, since it navigates. Role
    variants: `.cta-{success,danger,warning,info}`.
  - **`.btn`** — the affordance tier. Emitted as one zero-specificity `:where(button, .btn)` rule, so
    a bare `<button>` gets it with no class, `.btn` carries it to any other tag, and any explicit
    class (including `.cta`, or a component's own class) overrides it without `!important`.
  - **`:where(a, .link)`** — the link pattern now pairs its element with a class the same way.
  - A pattern may now set **both `element` and `class`**, emitting one combined
    `:where(<element>, .<class>)` rule. This is the general mechanism behind the above.
  - A pattern may declare **`fill: true|false`** to state whether states and role variants drive
    `background-color` (plus `on-solid` text) or `color`, instead of relying on the previous
    inference from the pattern's name and base declarations. Existing configs are unaffected — the
    old inference is still the fallback.

  **Breaking: `chip` is retired as vocabulary.** The two small-label patterns are now split by
  behaviour, not size: **`badge`** is a _static_ label (status, count, category) and **`tag`** is an
  _editable and/or dismissable_ one (e.g. entries in a filter list).
  - `.chip-list` → **`.tag-list`**, and its `--*-chip-list` / `--chip-list-focus-color` tokens →
    `--*-tag-list` / `--tag-list-focus-color`.
  - `.chip-list__chip` and `.chip-list__chip-remove` are **removed**. A tag list is a list of tags, so
    its items are now the existing `.tag` / `.tag__remove` — which also means they pick up tag role
    variants. **Migration:** replace `<span class="chip-list__chip">x <button
class="chip-list__chip-remove">` with `<span class="tag">x <button class="tag__remove">`. Note the
    items change appearance: `.tag` is outlined (border + neutral text) where the old chip was filled
    with `--color-surface-muted`.
  - The `radii.chip` primitive is **removed** from the example config; it was only ever an alias of
    `--br-tag`. Consumers who set `--br-chip` should use `--br-tag`.

  **Pattern geometry now resolves through the group alias layer.** Every grouped pattern already
  emitted `--<prop>-<name>-group` aliases (e.g. `--br-btn-group: var(--br-control)`), but most
  patterns bypassed them and hard-coded `var(--br-control, …)` into the rule. `btn`, `cta`, `badge`,
  `tag`, `card` and `status` now reference the alias and restate only their deviations via
  `overrides`, so the whole chain — `--p-btn` → `--p-btn-group` → `--p-control` → `--p-default` — is
  live CSS custom properties, inspectable and editable in the browser. Computed values are unchanged.

  Also fixed:
  - Role variants on element patterns were emitted at specificity 0-1-1 (`button.danger`), which
    outranked any plain class. They now emit as `:where(button, .btn).danger, .btn-danger` — both at
    class specificity, and reachable from a non-`<button>` host.
  - The `link` pattern declared `default_role: "brand-primary"` while hard-coding a `ui-primary` base
    colour, so hovering shifted hue instead of intensifying. Its `default_role` is now `ui-primary`.
  - `@getvitops/astro`'s `FormRenderer` defaulted its submit button to `class="btn btn-primary"`, a
    class that never existed and a role that is not emitted; it now defaults to `.cta`.
  - The Tailwind bundle is no longer assembled during `css` / `bricks` builds, where it was computed
    and discarded (it also read every framework partial off disk).

Set `inject: false` to stop the global `page-ssr` stylesheet injection and import the generated CSS from your site layout instead — needed when other integrations add routes that must not inherit the design system (e.g. EmDash's `/_emdash/admin`, which the auto-injected CSS was bleeding into).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d7e6491: Extract schema.org JSON-LD graph builders (articleGraph/organizationGraph/breadcrumbGraph/faqGraph) into @getvitops/utils so platform hooks (e.g. the new @getvitops/emdash plugin's future page:metadata contributions) can share them; the corresponding schemas/\*.astro become thin wrappers. Also removes Layout.astro's import of the deleted Polyfills.astro.
- Updated dependencies [d7e6491]
  - @getvitops/utils@0.4.0
  - @getvitops/core@0.4.0
  - @getvitops/generator@0.4.0
  - @getvitops/vite@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Extract the framework-agnostic content model + HTML helpers into `@getvitops/utils`
  (new `content`/`html` exports: `Elmnt`/`Link`/`ContentNode` types + guards, `t`,
  `partAttrs`, `parseRenderedSlots`, `toHtml`, `nodesToHtml`, `styleList`, …), and ship
  the generic Astro component tier from `@getvitops/astro/components/*`: `Subgrid`,
  `Cards`, `NodeRenderer`, `WebComponentLoader`, plus `Popover`/`Details`/`Drawer`
  (the latter three use `astro-icon`, now declared as an optional peer). Config-bound
  chrome (Template/SEO/ContentInfo/FormRenderer/Nav/Submenu) stays internal pending the
  EmDash integration.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4d89eca: Add Schema.org / JSON-LD structured-data components, exported at `@getvitops/astro/schemas/*`
  (`Article`, `Organization`, `LocalBusiness`, `Product`, `Review`, `Event`, `FAQ`, `Recipe`,
  `Breadcrumb`, `JobPosting`, and more) — each emits a typed `<script type="application/ld+json">`
  block at SSR time with no runtime JS. `Head.astro` moved to `src/components/` (the public
  `@getvitops/astro/Head.astro` import is unchanged).
