### Major Changes

- bb92a14: **The colour system is rebuilt on a target-prefixed grammar and a shared lightness ladder.**
  This is a breaking change to every colour token and utility class.

  ## Why

  Two axes shared one class namespace — functional _planes_ (`--<role>-bg-muted`) and
  appearance-relative _stops_ (`--color-<role>-muted`) — arbitrated by a "plane wins" rule. The
  result was not a scale. On the shipped palette, light mode:

  | class                              | resolved to  | step                                          |
  | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
  | `bg-ui-accent-x-muted`             | stop         | 100                                           |
  | `bg-ui-accent-muted`               | plane        | 100 — identical, so `x-muted` was a dead rung |
  | `bg-ui-accent`                     | plane        | 50 — _lighter_ than both its "muted" rungs    |
  | `border-ui-accent-muted` / `-bold` | stop / plane | 300 / 300 — identical                         |
  | `text-ui-accent-bold`              | stop         | 700 — _lighter_ than `text-…-muted` (800)     |

  Every family was non-monotonic, two had duplicate rungs, and `--color-<role>-muted` was
  unreachable through any `bg-` class.

  ## The new grammar

  ```
  --color-<target>-<role>[-<variant>]        target ∈ bg | text | icon | border
  ```

  The target is **inside** the name, so `bg-danger-muted` and `text-danger-muted` are different
  tokens and there is nothing left to arbitrate. **The class name is the token name minus
  `--color-`** — one vocabulary instead of two.

  Variants are ordinal (`xx-muted` < `x-muted` < `muted` < bare < `bold` < `x-bold`) and the
  tables are sparse: only cells that hold their contrast target exist.

  ## Role kinds

  `colors.roles` values may now be `{ hue, kind }` as well as a bare hue string:

  ```jsonc
  "roles": {
    "danger":  "rust",                             // shorthand => chromatic
    "surface": { "hue": "navy", "kind": "surface" }
  }
  ```

  - **`surface`** — a page/panel colour: `bg-<role>` is the card, `bg-<role>-muted` the page
    behind it, `bg-<role>-x-muted` a well, `bg-<role>-bold` the inverse surface. Full text scale.
  - **`chromatic`** (default) — a signal colour: tints (`bg-<role>-x-muted`/`-muted`) and solids
    (`bg-<role>-solid[-bold|-x-bold]`), with **no bare `bg-<role>`** — say how loud you mean.
    `text-on-<role>` is the guaranteed foreground for the solid family.

  ## Palette generation

  Every ramp now sits on one **fixed lightness ladder** (50 → L 0.98 … 950 → L 0.21); only chroma
  and hue vary. That is what makes a step mean the same lightness in every hue. Previously each
  seed transposed the curve, so relative luminance at step 300 ranged from 0.253 to 0.384 across
  the shipped palette — the same variant read differently depending on the role.

  Authored colours are still reproduced **exactly**. A `seed`, an `anchors` entry or a `tones`
  value is pinned verbatim at its nearest step; every other step takes the ladder. Snapping brand
  colours to the ladder was measured and rejected: 11 of 18 real brand hexes moved beyond a
  just-noticeable difference (worst ΔE-OK 0.050 — Facebook's `#1877F2` → `#0067e1`) and six left
  sRGB gamut. Deviation is now bounded and local to pinned steps, and warns past ~0.03 L.

  Two tones that claim the same step now **error** instead of one silently overwriting the other;
  the record form (`tones: { "600": "…", "700": "…" }`) is how you resolve it.

  ## New
  - **`icon-<role>`** — a non-text tier, so a glyph may run more vivid than text. `icon` is now a
    default utility family alongside `bg`/`text`/`border`.
  - **`--color-border-focus`** — the focus-ring tone, taken from `ui-primary`'s solid.
  - **Contrast is enforced at build time**, not only in tests: text ≥ APCA Lc 75 on its primary
    background, ≥ 60 on secondary planes, icons and surface boundaries ≥ 45, both appearances.
    A violation now fails `generate`. Chromatic text is checked against the _surface_ planes it
    actually sits on, not only its own tints. `text-<role>-x-muted` (placeholder) and `-xx-muted`
    (disabled) are explicitly exempt; nothing else is.

  ## Migrating

  Rename `--<role>-<suffix>` → `--color-<target>-<role>[-<variant>]`, and the same for classes:

  | before                                  | after                                                            |
  | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `--<role>-bg` / `bg-<role>` (chromatic) | `--color-bg-<role>-x-muted` / `bg-<role>-x-muted`                |
  | `--<role>-bg-muted`                     | `--color-bg-<role>-muted`                                        |
  | `--<role>-solid` / `-solid-bold`        | `--color-bg-<role>-solid` / `-solid-bold`                        |
  | `--<role>-on-solid` / `text-on-<role>`  | `--color-text-on-<role>` (class unchanged)                       |
  | `--<role>-text` / `-text-muted`         | `--color-text-<role>` / `-muted`                                 |
  | `--<role>-border` / `-border-bold`      | `--color-border-<role>` / `-bold`                                |
  | `--color-<role>-muted` (stop)           | judge by use: `--color-bg-<role>-muted` or `--color-text-<role>` |

  **`surface` background names rotate**, value-preserving: what was `--surface-bg` (the page) is
  now `--color-bg-surface-muted`; what was `--surface-bg-bold` (raised) is now
  `--color-bg-surface`. Elevation is expressed by which token you reach for — page `bg-muted`,
  card `bg` — rather than a raised/sunken pair, which is what lets a future surfaces axis flatten
  it without touching markup.

  `vitops lint` reports role classes that no longer resolve, and now derives its suggestions from
  what the generator actually emits rather than a hand-maintained list.

### Minor Changes

- bb92a14: Add a fourth output format, `design`, that emits `DESIGN.md` — the agent-facing brief in
  [google-labs-code/design.md](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) format.

  ```sh
  vitops generate --format design --out .     # DESIGN.md, and nothing else
  vitops generate --format css,design         # compose it with a stylesheet
  ```

  The file is YAML front matter carrying the tokens (`colors`, `typography`, `rounded`,
  `spacing`, `components`, cross-referenced with `{group.token}`) followed by a prose body
  carrying the rationale — colour model, fluid scales, layout vocabulary, elevation, shape
  cascade, component tiers, do's and don'ts. Every section is rendered from your config, so
  it cannot describe a system the other formats don't build. Point a coding agent, a Figma
  import, or a designer at this one file when they don't have the toolchain; `vitops docs`
  remains the richer reference for those who do.

  It is emitted with `--out .` in mind: DESIGN.md conventionally lives at a repo root beside
  `AGENTS.md`, not in a build directory.

  Three things the spec cannot express, handled the same way every time and explained in the
  emitted prose so the file is self-describing:
  - **Fluid `clamp()` sizes** → the maximum (desktop) value, since a spec `Dimension` is a
    bare number plus px/em/rem.
  - **Dark mode** → light values only, with the automatic functional flip explained. Role
    tokens are emitted as `{colors.<hue>-<step>}` references into the raw ramps rather than
    flattened hexes, so the role → ramp lineage survives the export — flattening them is
    exactly what breaks dark mode downstream.
  - **A `50%` radius** → dropped from `rounded` (it is not a `Dimension`) and named in the
    Shapes prose instead, so nothing is silently lost.

  **New:** an optional `meta` key in `design-system.json` (`{ name, description }`) supplies
  the brand name and the Overview paragraph. It affects no other format.

  **New:** `StylesheetFormat` (`Exclude<Format, 'design'>`), exported from
  `@getvitops/generator`. `@getvitops/astro`'s `css.format` now takes that narrower type —
  `design` produces no stylesheet to inject, so passing it there is a type error rather than
  a missing-file failure at build time. `vitops lint --format` is likewise restricted to the
  three CSS formats. No change for anyone already passing `tailwind`, `css` or `bricks`.

- bb92a14: Generate legal documents from your site config

  `vitops legal` renders a privacy policy, terms of service and cookie notice from a site
  config, in markdown, HTML or EmDash Portable Text:

  ```sh
  vitops legal --out ./content                 # every enabled document, as markdown
  vitops legal --doc privacy --format html     # one document, as an HTML fragment
  ```

  The documents are **derived from your config**, not filled into a form. The analytics
  provider they name is the one whose ID you set; the personal information they list is what
  your configured forms actually collect; the countries they name come from the providers you
  use. So a provider swap updates the policy on the next build, and the fix for a wrong policy
  is a corrected config — hand-editing the output is overwritten.

  Enable documents under `legal`, which gains the facts the prose asserts:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "legal": {
      "jurisdiction": "ca", // only 'ca' (PIPEDA) ships today
      "privacyPolicy": {
        "enabled": true,
        "lastUpdated": "2026-08-01",
        "retention": "24 months after our last contact with you",
        // Third parties the config cannot imply. Analytics, Turnstile and your
        // deploy platform are detected automatically — list only the rest.
        "processors": [
          {
            "name": "Stripe",
            "purpose": "payment processing",
            "country": "the United States",
          },
        ],
      },
      "termsOfService": { "enabled": true },
      "cookieConsent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "type": "opt-in",
        "categories": ["Essential", "Analytics"],
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  Delivery, by stack:
  - **Any stack** — `vitops legal`. No integration code; prints to stdout without `--out`.
  - **WordPress/Bricks** — `vitops generate --site <path>` also writes `dist/legal/*.html`, and
    the theme loader now registers `[vitops_legal doc="privacy"]` to render one in a page. The
    document updates on the next deploy with no action in WordPress.
  - **Astro** — `getvitops({ legal: { input: 'site.json', out: 'src/content/legal' } })` writes
    markdown into a content collection and re-renders when the site config changes. It needs a
    `css` config (that is what registers the Vite plugin); without one, use the CLI.
  - **EmDash** — `--format portable-text`, pasted into the admin.

  Also new on the public API: `generateLegal()`, `renderMarkdown()`, `renderNodes()`,
  `derivePolicyVars()`, `parseMarkdown()` / `toHtmlFragment()` / `toPortableText()`, and
  `resolvePrivacyContact()`.

  Two things to know before you publish anything this produces:
  - **It is not legal advice.** Every document opens with a review banner saying so. The
    bundled terms-of-service prose in particular is generic website boilerplate and
    deliberately does not cover sales, refunds, subscriptions, accounts or user-generated
    content — a site doing any of those needs clauses drafted for it.
  - **It is only as true as your config.** A policy asserting things your site does not do is
    worse than no policy. Check that the config describes reality before you ship the output.

  `validateSite` now rejects a config that enables a privacy policy without a contact for
  privacy requests or a `domains.canonical`, since both are interpolated into sentences that
  would otherwise render blank.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- **The `tailwind` format now emits the full role colour vocabulary.** It previously emitted only
  the functional role utilities, so 87 classes — `bg-<role>-x-muted`, `bg-<role>-bold`,
  `bg-<role>-x-bold`, `text-<role>-bold`, `text-<role>-x-bold`,
  `border-<role>-{muted,x-muted,x-bold}`, for every role — existed in the `css` and `bricks`
  outputs and silently did nothing in `tailwind`. Nothing in the test suite built the tailwind
  format, so the divergence was invisible; it was found by a consumer who hand-forked four
  background planes into their own stylesheet to work around the absence.

  All three formats now render from one emitter (`roleColorUtilities()`), which resolves the
  plane-vs-stop namespace collision explicitly instead of relying on the CSS minifier dropping a
  shadowed rule. No class changes meaning, and the `css`/`bricks` output is unchanged.

  Also fixed in the tailwind format:
  - `colors.utilities` is now honoured. It was hardcoded to `bg`/`text`/`border`, so enabling
    `outline`/`fill`/`stroke` worked in `css`/`bricks` and was ignored here. (For raw hue scales
    it remains a floor rather than a ceiling — those are `@theme` colours, and Tailwind derives
    every colour family from them on demand.)
  - **Component container queries are no longer stripped.** The pass that drops the framework's
    pre-expanded `md-*` breakpoint utilities (Tailwind regenerates those as `@md:`) matched every
    `@container (min-width: …)` block, including component behaviour — most visibly the
    sitenav's, so `.sitenav--bp-{sm,md,lg,xl}` were removed and the nav stayed in its mobile
    layout at every width.

  New: **`vitops lint`** reports framework classes in your source that resolve to nothing — the
  failure mode where an unknown utility looks exactly like a working one. It is format-aware
  (`md-flex-row` is a real class in `css`/`bricks` and inert in `tailwind`) and only judges
  classes anchored to your own config, so it stays quiet on Tailwind's utilities and your own.

  ```
  vitops lint --format tailwind --src src
  ```

### Minor Changes

- a334049: Make the semantic icon mapping reachable, and fail the build on unresolvable names.

  `generateIconInclude()` — declare the semantic icon names a site needs plus which sets to draw
  them from, get back the `include` map that keeps the bundle to just those glyphs — already existed
  but was unreachable: it lived in `@getvitops/core/src/utils/`, which the package doesn't export.
  It has moved to `@getvitops/utils` (a build-time concern, in the build-time utilities package),
  which `@getvitops/astro` re-exports wholesale. So from `astro.config.mjs`:

  ```js
  import { generateIconInclude } from '@getvitops/astro';
  import icon from 'astro-icon';

  integrations: [
    icon({
      include: generateIconInclude({
        ui: 'fa7-solid',
        brand: 'simple-icons',
        semantic: ['menu', 'close', 'search', 'github'],
      }),
    }),
  ];
  // → { "fa7-solid": ["bars","xmark","magnifying-glass"], "simple-icons": ["github"] }
  ```

  Swapping `ui` to `'lucide'` yields `{ lucide: ["menu","x","search"] }` from the same declaration —
  which is the point: the semantic names are what your markup commits to, and the set is a config
  choice. The output shape is the `include` both `astro-icon` and `astro-iconset` accept, so the
  mapping doesn't tie you to either.

  **Unresolvable names are now a build error.** Previously they were skipped silently, so swapping
  sets appeared to succeed and the gaps surfaced as missing glyphs in production. The error names
  every offender; an unknown set name throws too, listing the known sets.

  Also fixes `@getvitops/create`'s emdash template, which pinned `@getvitops/astro: ^0.4.0` — a range
  that stopped resolving when astro joined the fixed group at 0.7.0, so scaffolded projects were
  stuck on the old line.

- 58cb3d7: Fix two wrong paths in the live-editor manifest, and surface token-namespace collisions.

  **`validate()` now returns `warnings: string[]`** alongside `ok`/`data`/`errors`, for configs that
  parse and generate but won't behave as authored. `vitops validate` prints them. The field is always
  present, so existing code reading `ok`/`errors` is unaffected.

  The first warning covers a collision the flat `--<prop>-<name>` grammar allows: a `patterns.radii`
  key named after a pattern claims the same variable. The example config hits it —
  `patterns.radii.card` and the `card` pattern both want `--br-card`:

  ```
  ! patterns.radii.card collides with the "card" pattern on --br-card;
    the pattern's override hook wins — rename the radius
  ```

  **`design-manifest.json` reverse-index fixes** (affects the live editor's edit-to-config mapping):
  - Numeric colour steps mapped to `colors.palette.<hue>.seed`. The seed regenerates the whole ramp,
    so every step of a hue collapsed onto one path and editing two steps would silently keep one.
    They now map to `colors.palette.<hue>.anchors.<n>` — the schema's step → colour override.
  - `--br-<name>` resolved to `patterns.radii.<name>` even when a pattern owned the variable. Radii
    are now applied last and only where a pattern hasn't claimed it, matching what the CSS actually
    does.

### Patch Changes

- 611f340: `.cta` now defaults to the `ui-primary` role instead of `brand-primary`.

  The three tiers of one interaction family had split colour lineage: `:where(button, .btn)` and
  `:where(a, .link)` resolved to `ui-primary` while `.cta` alone used `brand-primary`. For a project
  whose brand and UI hues differ, that meant the focus ring changed colour depending on which tier
  you tabbed onto.

  Semantically the ui role is also the better fit — `brand-*` is identity, `ui-*` is the interface
  responding to you, and a CTA's prominence already comes from its fill, weight and padding rather
  than from borrowing the brand hue. Keeping brand as an explicit opt-in means a genuine brand moment
  still carries signal, and a rebrand restyles brand surfaces instead of silently restyling every
  form's submit button.

  **Migration:** none if `brand-primary` and `ui-primary` map to the same hue (the common case, and
  true of the example config). If they differ and you want the previous colour, add the new
  `.cta-brand-primary` variant — `brand-primary` has been added to `cta.roles`, so a brand-coloured
  CTA is reachable as a class rather than being unavailable.

- 46b129d: Make the dark-mode flip reachable outside Bricks.

  The dark functional-token block was emitted under `:root[data-brx-theme="dark"]` only.
  `data-brx-theme` is Bricks' own attribute — Bricks sets it, nothing else does — so on every other
  target the dark flip was unreachable. In particular the shipped `<color-scheme-toggle>` web
  component writes `documentElement.dataset.theme` (i.e. `data-theme`), so clicking "Dark" set an
  attribute no rule matched and the page stayed light.

  The block now matches `:root[data-brx-theme="dark"], :root[data-theme="dark"]`, which fixes the
  component everywhere without changing what Bricks already does. No migration needed.

  Note this covers the _explicit_ choice only. There is still no `prefers-color-scheme` block, so the
  toggle's "System" position resolves to light. Adding one would flip every existing consumer site
  dark for dark-OS users, which is a product decision rather than a bug fix.

- aa2863d: Persist the colour scheme across navigations, and drop the UA body margin.

  **The colour scheme now sticks.** `<color-scheme-toggle>` records the explicit choice in
  `localStorage` (`vitops-color-scheme`) and restores it on load. Previously every navigation reset
  to System — the component defaulted to `system` on each page and its `disconnectedCallback` even
  deleted the attribute on unmount, so the scheme was per-page state rather than a user preference.
  Choosing System clears the key, so a visitor can go back to following their OS.

  `<Head />` from `@getvitops/astro` now also emits a tiny synchronous script that applies the stored
  value **before first paint**. Without it the persisted choice would still work, but every page
  would render light and flip once the deferred element bundle upgraded. A test asserts the storage
  key stays in step between the two (they can't share an import: core exports only prebuilt bundles,
  and the Head script must be a literal in the emitted HTML).

  **`body { margin: 0 }`** is now part of the framework. The UA's 8px margin offset every full-bleed
  surface — sticky headers and `bg-*` bands rendered inset with a sliver of canvas around them, since
  the framework owns page gutters through `.centered`'s `--gutter`. This is the only UA reset the
  framework makes; it deliberately still ships no general reset (no global `box-sizing` change),
  which would silently reflow existing layouts.

  **Migration:** if you were compensating for the body margin with a negative offset or your own
  `body { margin: 0 }`, you can drop it. Sites relying on the 8px inset will need to add their own
  padding.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 44de07f: Split the button pattern into two tiers named by intent: `.cta` (persuasion) and `.btn`
  (affordance).

  **Breaking: a bare `<button>` is no longer a filled brand-primary button.** It now renders as a
  quiet interactive control — geometry, cursor, subtle hover, focus ring — with no fill, no
  `font-weight: 600`, and no shadow.

  **Migration:** add `class="cta"` to any button that should stay prominent. Submit buttons, hero
  actions, and anything driving a conversion are the usual candidates; dialog closes, toolbar
  buttons, icon buttons and toggles should keep the new default. If you want the old behaviour
  globally, set `patterns.items.btn` in your `design-system.json` back to the previous filled base.

  New in this release:
  - **`.cta`** — filled, bolder, roomier, lifts on hover. It is a class, not an element rule, so it
    finally works on `<a>` — which is what a call to action usually is, since it navigates. Role
    variants: `.cta-{success,danger,warning,info}`.
  - **`.btn`** — the affordance tier. Emitted as one zero-specificity `:where(button, .btn)` rule, so
    a bare `<button>` gets it with no class, `.btn` carries it to any other tag, and any explicit
    class (including `.cta`, or a component's own class) overrides it without `!important`.
  - **`:where(a, .link)`** — the link pattern now pairs its element with a class the same way.
  - A pattern may now set **both `element` and `class`**, emitting one combined
    `:where(<element>, .<class>)` rule. This is the general mechanism behind the above.
  - A pattern may declare **`fill: true|false`** to state whether states and role variants drive
    `background-color` (plus `on-solid` text) or `color`, instead of relying on the previous
    inference from the pattern's name and base declarations. Existing configs are unaffected — the
    old inference is still the fallback.

  **Breaking: `chip` is retired as vocabulary.** The two small-label patterns are now split by
  behaviour, not size: **`badge`** is a _static_ label (status, count, category) and **`tag`** is an
  _editable and/or dismissable_ one (e.g. entries in a filter list).
  - `.chip-list` → **`.tag-list`**, and its `--*-chip-list` / `--chip-list-focus-color` tokens →
    `--*-tag-list` / `--tag-list-focus-color`.
  - `.chip-list__chip` and `.chip-list__chip-remove` are **removed**. A tag list is a list of tags, so
    its items are now the existing `.tag` / `.tag__remove` — which also means they pick up tag role
    variants. **Migration:** replace `<span class="chip-list__chip">x <button
class="chip-list__chip-remove">` with `<span class="tag">x <button class="tag__remove">`. Note the
    items change appearance: `.tag` is outlined (border + neutral text) where the old chip was filled
    with `--color-surface-muted`.
  - The `radii.chip` primitive is **removed** from the example config; it was only ever an alias of
    `--br-tag`. Consumers who set `--br-chip` should use `--br-tag`.

  **Pattern geometry now resolves through the group alias layer.** Every grouped pattern already
  emitted `--<prop>-<name>-group` aliases (e.g. `--br-btn-group: var(--br-control)`), but most
  patterns bypassed them and hard-coded `var(--br-control, …)` into the rule. `btn`, `cta`, `badge`,
  `tag`, `card` and `status` now reference the alias and restate only their deviations via
  `overrides`, so the whole chain — `--p-btn` → `--p-btn-group` → `--p-control` → `--p-default` — is
  live CSS custom properties, inspectable and editable in the browser. Computed values are unchanged.

  Also fixed:
  - Role variants on element patterns were emitted at specificity 0-1-1 (`button.danger`), which
    outranked any plain class. They now emit as `:where(button, .btn).danger, .btn-danger` — both at
    class specificity, and reachable from a non-`<button>` host.
  - The `link` pattern declared `default_role: "brand-primary"` while hard-coding a `ui-primary` base
    colour, so hovering shifted hue instead of intensifying. Its `default_role` is now `ui-primary`.
  - `@getvitops/astro`'s `FormRenderer` defaulted its submit button to `class="btn btn-primary"`, a
    class that never existed and a role that is not emitted; it now defaults to `.cta`.
  - The Tailwind bundle is no longer assembled during `css` / `bricks` builds, where it was computed
    and discarded (it also read every framework partial off disk).

- 44de07f: Shared toolchain version + changelogs that reach consumers.
  - **`@getvitops/astro` now shares the toolchain version** (`core`/`generator`/`utils`/`cli`/`vite`),
    so it moves from its own `0.4.x` line onto the group's. The number changes; the package does not —
    install it at the same version as `@getvitops/cli`. It was already being bumped on every toolchain
    release by its dependency updates, and it depends on core, generator, utils _and_ vite, so a
    separate version line cost the same churn while leaving the compatible pairing implicit. The
    lockstep is load-bearing: the generator ships a snapshot of core's CSS + web-component bundles
    while the Astro integration copies the _installed_ core's bundles, so mismatched versions can leave
    the CSS and the components disagreeing.

  - **Every package now ships its `CHANGELOG.md` in the published tarball.** npm does not include
    changelogs by default, so none of this history previously reached anyone who installed the
    packages. Per-package history now reads from `node_modules/@getvitops/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md`;
    curated toolchain-level release notes live in the repo's root `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Patch Changes

- @getvitops/generator@0.7.0
- @getvitops/utils@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2cc847d: Package-resident agent skill + `vitops docs`:
  - `@getvitops/cli` now ships the `vitops-design-system` agent skill inside the package
    (`skill/SKILL.md`). `vitops agents` no longer emits a generated skill into the repo — it
    symlinks `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` entries to the installed package (logical
    `node_modules/@getvitops/cli/skill` target, surviving version bumps) and writes the
    AGENTS.md pointer block. Old generated-skill directories are migrated automatically;
    `--docs-dir` keeps the emit-files layout.
  - New `vitops docs [topic]` command prints reference docs to stdout, rendered live from the
    project's `design-system.json` (topics: classes, authoring, formats, color, scales,
    patterns, elements; `--all` concatenates).
  - `renderSkill()` removed from `@getvitops/generator` (superseded by the packaged skill).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [2cc847d]
  - @getvitops/generator@0.6.0
  - @getvitops/utils@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Ship design-system context to downstream agents:
  - JSON Schema descriptions: every `design-system.json` and site-config field now carries a
    `description` (authored in the zod schemas via `desc()`), emitted into `schema.json` /
    `site.schema.json` for editor hovers and agent consumption.
  - New generated OKF docs: `authoring.md` (field reference walked from the JSON Schema),
    `formats.md` (tailwind vs css vs bricks, including the TW_CLASH utilities Tailwind
    provides natively), and `concepts/{color,scales,patterns}.md` (seeded OKLCH colour
    system, fluid modular scales, pattern token cascade + override hooks).
  - `vitops agents` now emits a generated `vitops-design-system` agent skill into
    `.agents/skills/vitops-design-system/` (SKILL.md + the docs bundle as `references/`,
    with an idempotent `.claude/skills/` symlink) and writes a compact pointer block into
    `AGENTS.md`. Pass `--docs-dir` for the legacy docs-only layout.
  - `TW_CLASH` and `BASE_HOOK` are exported from `@getvitops/generator`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d35515e: Add `vitops agents` — writes a managed, marker-delimited block into a consumer's `AGENTS.md`
  (or `--out CLAUDE.md`) so AI coding agents can discover the CLI and the design-system class/element
  vocabulary. Idempotent (re-run to update between the `<!-- vitops:start -->`/`<!-- vitops:end -->`
  markers) and also emits the OKF docs bundle it points at (`--docs-dir`, default `.vitops/docs`).
